 Thanks for downloading Dir3D
I won't take credit, the class files and mods are from microsoft
the DX8 SDK, i have made changes to them so if i were you i would
download it myself, and use the originals, or at least parts.

  This is far from done, but i'm still trying to learn, vb and
dx8 and now a couple cad programs, and transfering that to x files...
the list goes on and on, and i drive truck for a living, this is a hobby...

  If you like the idea, and you know vb, and directx
i would love to see a app like this. I haven't started how i'll do the files
yet. 

  Have a look, let me know what you think.
